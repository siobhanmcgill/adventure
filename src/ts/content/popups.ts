Dear Eric Jenkuns,

Your request to update the primary billing owner on your account has been processed. 

If you requested this change, no further action is required. However, if this wasn't you, you should probably call us to get it sorted out, unless someone has stolen your comlink account in which case you probably cannot call us. In that event, please respond to this message with the name and address of your identity thief, and we will update our records for the new owner of your identity. 

Have a nice day, and thank you for trusting CyberCom for your comlink needs. 

Sincerely, Deedo Quandary, CyberCom. 

_P.S. have you tried our new Max Plus Deluxe and Max Plus Deluxe Mini comlinks? The digital clarity will blow you away!_

Hey, just checking in to see if you sent in that form to update the comlink yet? It's been a few days. I hope you're doing okay. -Jace
